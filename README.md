# BattleShip
This is a final group project for Engineering 101 in which we created a MATLAB Simulation of the Classic Game BattleShip. 
In this game, the use can either play with a friend or play with the computer. When playing with the computer, the user can choose a easy mode or difficult mode. In the easy mode, the computer uses a random mode algorithm in which the hits are guessed randomly. Think that's too easy? Try the difficult mode. In this mode, the computer uses two different types of algorithms (hunt &target & sink) to beat the user. After testing out the game 600 times, 300 times in Easy Mode and 300 times in Difficult Mode, the computer lost all 300 times in Easy Mode, whereas under the algorithms, the computer won 114 times out of 300, representing a 38% probability of winning against the user with the algorithms. The game also uses a user-friendly GUI (see file Battleship_Preview) in which the place of the ships, the name of the ship, and the hits& misses of both players are all color-coded and displayed for the user to see. This program also uses 15 different functions to implement the game and prevent any user errors.
